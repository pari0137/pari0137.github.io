    <main>
        <p> I am 19 years old and from Gatineau, Quebec. I have <em>always</em> had a passion for all art styles. In elementary school, I excelled in classes like art and english and was never very good at math. I lost touch with my creative side throughout highschool trying to acheive what I thought to be success. In my mind, I had to be something like a doctor, nurse or some other health care professional in order to be successful and have a fulfilling life. This mindset led me into the Pre-Health program at Algonquin. I was in and out of the program for two years. My 2 <sup>nd</sup> attempt at the program, I finally realized that it was not my learning style and was not where I wanted to be in the future. In order to be truly happy, I knew I needed that creative outlet in my life and asked myself what was stopping me from making a living off of my creativity. This led me into finding the Interavtive Media Design program and falling in love with it as it had every subject I wanted to learn.</p>

        <p> Today, I am in this program and extremely eager to learn as much as I can in the time that we have. I am familiar and have experience in all of our courses except for coding. It always terrified me and fascinated me at the same time and I have always wanted to learn. I am most excited to learn <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. My goal and what I hope to acheive coming out of this program would be to be a UX designer but also work on my own and do freelance. I cannot wait to be able to build a website from the ground up and be able to incorporate my art into it. My dream is to be able to do what I love and still be able to travel and live anywhere in the world. I never thought that I would be where I am today and I cannot wait to start my creative journey!</p>
