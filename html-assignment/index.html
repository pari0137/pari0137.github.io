    <main>
        <p> I am 19 years old and from Gatineau, Quebec. I have always had a passion for all art styles. In elementary school, I excelled in classes like art and english and was never very good at math. I lost touch with my creative side throughout highschool trying to acheive what I thought to be success. In my mid, I had to be something like a doctor, nurse or some other health care professional in order to be successful and have a fulfilling life. This mindset led me into the Pre-Health program at Algonquin. I was in and out of the program for two years until I finally realized that it was not my learning style and was not where I wanted to be in the future. In order to be truly happy, I knew I needed that creative outlet in my life and asked myself what was stopping me from making a living off of my creativity. This led me into finding the Interavtive Media Design program and falling in love with it as it had every subject I wanted to learn.</p>
