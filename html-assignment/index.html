    <main>
        <p> I am 19 years old and from Gatineau, Quebec. I have always had a passion for all art styles. In elementary school, I excelled in classes like art and english and was never very good at math. I lost touch with my creative side throughout highschool trying to acheive what I thought to be success. In my mid, I had to be something like a doctor, nurse or some other health care professional in order to be successful and have a fulfilling life.
